# D-I Baseline

**D-I Baseline** is a starting point for setting up styles on SCSS based project.

## Usage

To use baseline, download the repo and move the files from `source` to the stylesheets directory in your project.

Some of the modules in Baseline take advantage of flexbox, so if you require backward compatability, be sure to include a build of Modernizr that checks for flexbox browser support like [baseline-modernizr](https://github.com/the-refinery/baseline-modernizr).
